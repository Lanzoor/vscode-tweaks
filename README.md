# 🎨✨ Welcome to VSCode Tweaks! ✨🎨

Hey there! 👋 Ready to supercharge your VSCode with **beautiful effects, animations, and overlays** that’ll make your editor come alive? Let’s get your VSCode looking absolutely aesthetic. Follow along! It gets a bit manual, but I promise - it will be worth it!

**Make sure to read this till the end, because there are lot's of FAQs you might need to consider!**

---

## 🧩 Step 1 - Install the Custom CSS Extension

We’ll need **be5invis.vscode-custom-css** to load our styles!

- Open the **Extensions** sidebar in VSCode
- Search for `be5invis.vscode-custom-css`
- Click **Install** ✅

Or just install it using your terminal.

```sh
code --install-extension be5invis.vscode-custom-css
```

---

## 📦 Step 2 - Download the VSCode Overlays

### 🐧 On Linux:

```sh
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/Lanzoor/vscode-overlays.git
```

### 🪟 On Windows:

Head to 👉 [https://github.com/Lanzoor/vscode-overlays/releases/latest/](https://github.com/Lanzoor/vscode-overlays/releases/latest/) Then click **Source Code (zip)** to download the source code. Unzip it somewhere comfy - like your Downloads folder!

---

## ⚙️ Step 3 - Add the Tweaks to Your `settings.json`

Add the following entries to your `settings.json` file! Make sure to tweak the locations based on where the files are actually at.

### 🐧 Linux:

```json
{
    "vscode_custom_css.imports": ["file:///home/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/styles.css", "file:///home/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/overlays.js", "file:///home/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/modals.js", "file:///home/{YOUR USERNAME}/vscode-overlays/mouseeffects.js"]
}
```

### 🪟 Windows:

```json
{
    "vscode_custom_css.imports": ["file:///C:/Users/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/styles.css", "file:///C:/Users/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/overlays.js", "file:///C:/Users/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/modals.js", "file:///C:/Users/{YOUR USERNAME}/Downloads/vscode-overlays/mouseeffects.js"]
}
```

> 💡 **Tip:** If you’ve got _other themes or scripts, **especially those that inject JS and CSS**,_ messing with VSCode visuals, consider disabling them first! Mixing too many visuals may result in weird results and visuals. **This overlay was designed with dark themes in mind, so why not grab one?**

---

## 🔄 Step 4 - Restart and Activate

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** to open the command panel.
2. Type **Enable Custom CSS and JS**.
3. Click it!
4. VSCode will show you a pop-up, saying you need to restart after changing, click **Restart Visual Studio Code**

And just like that, you can enjoy the new experience!

---

## 🧠 Notes & Troubleshooting

> **NOTE: If VSCode crashes or/and fails to open, a fresh reinstall will fix it.** Just make sure to backup your settings and stuff.

### ⚠️ Linux Permissions

If VSCode complains about permissions, run this:

```sh
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/share/code/
```

You must have read/write permission on the VSCode installation for the CSS and JS tweaks to work.

### 🔁 After Updates

VSCode breaks these tweaks after updates. If that happens:

- Re-run the `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Enable Custom CSS and JS` command
- _If you’re on Linux, maybe re-run the chown command too if VSCode complains about permissions_
- Restart VSCode again

### 🚨 “VSCode installation is corrupted” warning

Don’t panic, it’s totally normal. You can **safely ignore it**. You can click the small cog icon (⚙️), and click **Don't Show Again**. Bye-bye!

### How to Update vscode-overlays

On Linux;

```sh
cd ~/Downloads/vscode-overlays
git pull
```

On Windows, you might have to download the files manually on GitHub. Head to 👉 [https://github.com/Lanzoor/vscode-overlays/releases/latest/](https://github.com/Lanzoor/vscode-overlays/releases/latest/) Then click **Source Code (zip)** to download the source code. Unzip it, and replace the old files.

By the way, until I make an automatic update system, you still might want to check frequently for updates. Sorry!

🎉 **And that’s it!** You now have a supercharged, stylish, animated VSCode setup! Feel free to tweak the JS and CSS files yourself to your liking. You can even add your OWN funny overlays!
